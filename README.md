# Random.homes
Random Homes is.. well, it's the name. We will show you a random home, on Zillow!

## How does it work?
Good question! I did the research within Zillow, they have an ID within their URL. This allows me to randomly generate `1` through `98031697`, and then put it within the URL `https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/${int}_zpid/`!

## Future Goals
- Instead of redirect, I want it to be a part of the website.
- Address Search, possibly with a map? (Might defeat the purpose of the project)
- We can have an "Explore" Mode, where we can search for a specific address, and then show the surrounding homes.
- We can also have a "Random" Mode, where we can search for a random address, and then show the surrounding homes. 
- Possibly a GeoGuesser type of thing? (Not sure if this is a good idea)
- Save the homes to a database, so we can have a "Saved Homes" section.
- Community Profiles, where community members can show their saved homes, and other community members can comment on them.
- Report System, where users can report homes that are not real homes.
- Zillow Check, where it checks the URL to see if it works.
