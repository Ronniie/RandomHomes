# Random.homes
Random Homes is.. well, it's the name. We will show you a random home, on Zillow!

## How does it work?
Good question! I did the research within Zillow, they have an ID within their URL. This allows me to randomly generate `1` through `98031697`, and then put it within the URL `https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/${int}_zpid/`!

## Future Goals
- Instead of redirect, I want it to be apart of the website.
- Navigation, with search and re-roll.
